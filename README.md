# KawaiiML

An open source machine learning framework in very early development.

# Intentions

This is the beginning of an open source machine learning framework that I intend to develop. I want to gain more experience in machine learning, so I'm going to implement some machine learning algorithms myself and share a repository of those algorithms.

## Todo

### Algorithms to implement:

* [ ] k-means clustering
  * [X] hard k-means clustering
  * [ ] soft k-means clustering
* [ ] simple linear regression
* [ ] perceptron neural network

### Helper functions:

* [X] gradient descent using mean squared error cost function for a set of training sample pairs
* [ ] single perceptron
* [ ] sigmoid activation function

# Notes

* Uses Python 2
* Uses numpy often for the benefit of accuracy and ease of development (to the point of better enabling me to implement algorithms myself)
