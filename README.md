# KawaiiML

An open source machine learning framework in very early development.

# Intentions

This is the beginning of an open source machine learning framework that I intend to develop. I want to gain more experience in machine learning, so I'm going to implement some machine learning algorithms myself and share a repository of those algorithms.

## Todo

### Algorithms to implement:

* k-means clustering
  * hard k-means clustering
  * soft k-means clustering
* simple linear regression
* perceptron neural network

# Notes

* Uses Python 2
* Uses numpy often for the benefit of accuracy and ease of development (to the point of better enabling me to implement algorithms myself)
